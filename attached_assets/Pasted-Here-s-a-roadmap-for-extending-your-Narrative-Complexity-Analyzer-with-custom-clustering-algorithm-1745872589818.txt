Here’s a roadmap for extending your Narrative Complexity Analyzer with **custom clustering algorithms** and **real-time dashboards**, all tied together in a scalable streaming architecture:

**Summary:**  
We recommend integrating advanced streaming clustering methods—**SECLEDS** for evolving medoid clustering  ([SECLEDS: Sequence Clustering in Evolving Data Streams via Multiple Medoids and Medoid Voting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12190?utm_source=chatgpt.com)), **ERBM-KNet** for adaptive neural‐Kohonen clustering  ([Evolving Restricted Boltzmann Machine-Kohonen Network for Online Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09167?utm_source=chatgpt.com)), and **CluStRE** for multi‐stage streaming graph clustering  ([CluStRE: Streaming Graph Clustering with Multi-Stage Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06879?utm_source=chatgpt.com))—alongside density‐based incremental algorithms like **DenStream** and **CluStream**  ([Stream normalization for online clustering in evolving environments](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60860178/stream-normalization-for-online-clustering-in-evolving-environments?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). Complement these with graph‐based community detection (e.g., Louvain in NetworkX)  ([louvain_communities — NetworkX 3.4.2 documentation](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.community.louvain.louvain_communities.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) and classic online clustering (e.g., BIRCH via Apache Beam)  ([Online Clustering Example - Apache Beam®](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/ml/online-clustering/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). For visualization, build dashboards in **Streamlit**  ([How to build a real-time live dashboard with Streamlit](https://blog.streamlit.io/how-to-build-a-real-time-live-dashboard-with-streamlit/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) or **Dash+Tinybird**  ([Build a real-time dashboard in Python with Tinybird and Dash](https://www.tinybird.co/blog-posts/python-real-time-dashboard?utm_source=chatgpt.com)), rendering interactive network graphs, Sankey diagrams  ([Sankey diagram in Python - Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/sankey-diagram/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)), and temporal heatmaps. Finally, use a message-queue backbone (e.g., Kafka or Pub/Sub) to feed embeddings from Hugging Face or custom pipelines, ensuring real-time updates and horizontal scalability  ([Adapting to Change: Enhancing Real-Time Data Analysis Through ...](https://medium.com/thedeephub/adapting-to-change-enhancing-real-time-data-analysis-through-dynamic-clustering-c35845a462ea?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

## 1. Custom Clustering Algorithms

### 1.1 SECLEDS: Medoid Voting in Streams  
**SECLEDS** is a streaming k-medoids variant that maintains multiple medoids per cluster and adapts to concept drift via a voting scheme, all with constant memory footprint—ideal for high‐velocity narrative streams  ([SECLEDS: Sequence Clustering in Evolving Data Streams via Multiple Medoids and Medoid Voting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12190?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### 1.2 ERBM-KNet: Neural Evolution for Online Clustering  
The **Evolving RBM-Kohonen Network (ERBM-KNet)** embeds an adaptive Boltzmann machine with a Kohonen map to grow/prune neurons and update cluster centers in a single pass, removing the need for pre-specified cluster counts  ([Evolving Restricted Boltzmann Machine-Kohonen Network for Online Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09167?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### 1.3 CluStRE: Streaming Graph Clustering  
**CluStRE** processes graph data in a streaming fashion, building a quotient graph and refining clusters via modularity heuristics in multiple stages—achieving near in-memory quality with reduced overhead  ([CluStRE: Streaming Graph Clustering with Multi-Stage Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06879?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### 1.4 Density-Based & Micro-Cluster Methods  
Algorithms like **DenStream** and **CluStream** maintain evolving micro-clusters for density-based clustering in streams, adjusting to drifting narrative densities without full reprocessing  ([Stream normalization for online clustering in evolving environments](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60860178/stream-normalization-for-online-clustering-in-evolving-environments?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### 1.5 Hybrid & Classical Online Techniques  
- **Online k-Means** and **BIRCH** can be applied via frameworks like Apache Beam for text embedding streams  ([Online Clustering Example - Apache Beam®](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/ml/online-clustering/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
- For network‐style clustering on narrative similarity graphs, use **Louvain** for community detection in NetworkX  ([louvain_communities — NetworkX 3.4.2 documentation](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.community.louvain.louvain_communities.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
- Leverage scikit-learn’s clustering module for prototyping classical methods (e.g., DBSCAN, Agglomerative) and hybrid approaches  ([2.3. Clustering — scikit-learn 1.6.1 documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

## 2. Real-Time Dashboards

### 2.1 Dashboard Frameworks  
- **Streamlit** offers rapid Python‐only dashboard development with auto-refresh for live data  ([How to build a real-time live dashboard with Streamlit](https://blog.streamlit.io/how-to-build-a-real-time-live-dashboard-with-streamlit/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
- **Dash** (Plotly) combined with **Tinybird** provides scalable, serverless real-time analytics and interactivity  ([Build a real-time dashboard in Python with Tinybird and Dash](https://www.tinybird.co/blog-posts/python-real-time-dashboard?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### 2.2 Streaming Ingestion & Back-End  
- Use **Apache Kafka** or **Google Pub/Sub** to ingest narrative embeddings or metadata in real time.  
- For transformation pipelines, consider **Apache Beam** with its built-in online clustering examples  ([Online Clustering Example - Apache Beam®](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/ml/online-clustering/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### 2.3 Visualization Components  
- **Network graphs**: Render clusters and inter-narrative edges with NetworkX + Plotly.  
- **Sankey diagrams**: Map cluster membership flows over time using Plotly’s Sankey API  ([Sankey diagram in Python - Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/sankey-diagram/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
- **Time-series & heatmaps**: Show narrative volume or sentiment trends per cluster.

### 2.4 Deployment & Scalability  
- Containerize dashboards with **Docker**; orchestrate with **Kubernetes** for horizontal scaling.  
- Use CDN-backed object storage (e.g., S3) for static assets; enable WebSockets or SSE for low-latency updates.

### 2.5 Best Practices  
- **Decouple** clustering services from visualization via REST or gRPC.  
- **Batch** versus **stream** delineation: reserve expensive re-clustering for low-latency tolerance paths.  
- **Monitoring**: instrument pipelines with metrics (Prometheus/Grafana) and alert on lag or drift anomalies.

By combining these **advanced streaming algorithms** with **interactive real-time dashboards**, you’ll achieve a fully featured Narrative Complexity Analyzer capable of clustering evolving storylines, revealing coordinated patterns, and delivering live insights through dynamic visualizations.
