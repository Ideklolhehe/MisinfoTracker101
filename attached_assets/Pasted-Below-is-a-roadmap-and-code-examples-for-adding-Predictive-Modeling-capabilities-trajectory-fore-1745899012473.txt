Below is a roadmap and code examples for adding **Predictive Modeling** capabilities—trajectory forecasting, threshold projections, confidence intervals, driver analysis, and what-if scenarios—to your Narrative Complexity Analyzer.

## Summary  
You can leverage specialized time-series libraries such as **Prophet** for tractable forecasts with built-in uncertainty quantification  ([Time Series Forecasting with Prophet: An High Level mini-Guide ...](https://medium.com/%40nachi-keta/time-series-forecasting-with-prophet-an-high-level-mini-guide-and-optimization-tips-db02019d6de2?utm_source=chatgpt.com)), **Darts** for a unified API across classical and deep models  ([Time Series Made Easy in Python — darts documentation](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)), and **DeepAR** (via GluonTS) for multi-series neural forecasting  ([DeepAR Forecasting Algorithm | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deepar-forecasting-algorithm/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  For threshold predictions, utilize **exceedance probability forecasting** to estimate the chance of narratives crossing critical complexity levels  ([An Introduction to Exceedance Probability Forecasting - Medium](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/an-introduction-to-exceedance-probability-forecasting-4c96c0e7772c?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  Confidence intervals come out-of-the-box in both Prophet and Statsmodels state-space models  ([Forecasting in statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/examples/notebooks/generated/statespace_forecasting.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [confidence and prediction intervals with StatsModels - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17559408/confidence-and-prediction-intervals-with-statsmodels?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  Identify key complexity drivers via **permutation feature importance** or **tsfresh** automated feature extraction  ([Feature importances with a forest of trees - Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/ensemble/plot_forest_importances.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Creating Powerful Time Series Features with tsfresh - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/creating-powerful-time-series-features-with-tsfresh/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  Finally, deploy **Monte Carlo simulations** for what-if scenario planning and **CausalImpact** for intervention analysis  ([Scenario Analysis in Python: Advanced Investment Risk ... - Medium](https://medium.com/coinmonks/scenario-analysis-in-python-advanced-investment-risk-analysis-d7d550237295?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [WillianFuks/tfcausalimpact: Python Causal Impact ... - GitHub](https://github.com/WillianFuks/tfcausalimpact?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

## 1. AI-Powered Complexity Trajectory Forecasting  

### 1.1 Facebook Prophet  
```python
from fbprophet import Prophet
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'ds': timestamps,       # datetime list
    'y': complexity_scores  # daily complexity metric
})
m = Prophet(interval_width=0.8)  # 80% confidence interval
m.fit(df)
future = m.make_future_dataframe(periods=30)
forecast = m.predict(future)
```
Prophet automatically estimates trend and seasonality, and returns prediction intervals via `yhat_lower` and `yhat_upper`  ([Time Series Forecasting with Prophet: An High Level mini-Guide ...](https://medium.com/%40nachi-keta/time-series-forecasting-with-prophet-an-high-level-mini-guide-and-optimization-tips-db02019d6de2?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### 1.2 Darts  
```python
from darts import TimeSeries
from darts.models import RNNModel

series = TimeSeries.from_times_and_values(timestamps, complexity_scores)
model = RNNModel(model='LSTM', input_chunk_length=14, output_chunk_length=7)
model.fit(series)
forecast = model.predict(30)
```
Darts provides a scikit-learn-style API for classic (ARIMA) and neural (LSTM, TCN) models under one roof  ([Time Series Made Easy in Python — darts documentation](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### 1.3 DeepAR (GluonTS)  
```python
from gluonts.model.deepar import DeepAREstimator
from gluonts.trainer import Trainer
from darts import TimeSeries

# Convert to GluonTS format then:
estimator = DeepAREstimator(
    freq="D",
    prediction_length=30,
    trainer=Trainer(epochs=20)
)
predictor = estimator.train(training_data)
forecast_it, ts_it = predictor.predict(test_data)
```
DeepAR excels at forecasting multiple related narrative streams together, capturing shared patterns  ([DeepAR Forecasting Algorithm | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deepar-forecasting-algorithm/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

## 2. Projected Timeline to Critical Thresholds  

### 2.1 Exceedance Probability Forecasting  
```python
# After obtaining forecasted series with Prophet or Darts:
threshold = critical_value
prob_exceed = (forecast['yhat'] > threshold).mean()
```
Exceedance probability methods estimate the chance a metric will surpass a defined threshold in the forecast horizon  ([An Introduction to Exceedance Probability Forecasting - Medium](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/an-introduction-to-exceedance-probability-forecasting-4c96c0e7772c?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

## 3. Confidence Intervals for Predictions  

### 3.1 In Prophet  
Prophet’s `predict()` yields `yhat_lower` and `yhat_upper`, representing the lower and upper bounds of the chosen prediction interval  ([Time Series Forecasting with Prophet: An High Level mini-Guide ...](https://medium.com/%40nachi-keta/time-series-forecasting-with-prophet-an-high-level-mini-guide-and-optimization-tips-db02019d6de2?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### 3.2 In Statsmodels  
```python
import statsmodels.api as sm

model = sm.tsa.SARIMAX(df.y, order=(1,1,1)).fit()
pred = model.get_forecast(steps=30)
ci = pred.conf_int()  # DataFrame with lower & upper
```
State-space models in Statsmodels support confidence and prediction intervals via `get_forecast().conf_int()`  ([Forecasting in statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/examples/notebooks/generated/statespace_forecasting.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [confidence and prediction intervals with StatsModels - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17559408/confidence-and-prediction-intervals-with-statsmodels?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

## 4. Key Factor Identification for Complexity Drivers  

### 4.1 Permutation Feature Importance (scikit-learn)  
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.inspection import permutation_importance

rf = RandomForestRegressor().fit(X_features, y_complexity)
imp = permutation_importance(rf, X_features, y_complexity, n_repeats=10)
```
Permutation importance quantifies each feature’s impact on forecast error by shuffling inputs  ([Feature importances with a forest of trees - Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/ensemble/plot_forest_importances.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### 4.2 Automated Feature Extraction (tsfresh)  
```python
from tsfresh import extract_features

extracted = extract_features(df_timeseries, column_id="narrative_id", column_sort="timestamp")
```
tsfresh can generate hundreds of time-series features (e.g., mean, autocorrelation) to feed into a driver analysis model  ([Creating Powerful Time Series Features with tsfresh - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/creating-powerful-time-series-features-with-tsfresh/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

## 5. What-If Scenario Modeling for Intervention Planning  

### 5.1 Monte Carlo Simulation  
```python
import numpy as np

def simulate_trajectories(mu, sigma, steps, sims=1000):
    return np.cumsum(mu + sigma * np.random.randn(sims, steps), axis=1)

simulated = simulate_trajectories(pred_mean, pred_std, 30)
```
Monte Carlo generates randomized future paths to assess variability and plan interventions under uncertainty  ([Scenario Analysis in Python: Advanced Investment Risk ... - Medium](https://medium.com/coinmonks/scenario-analysis-in-python-advanced-investment-risk-analysis-d7d550237295?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### 5.2 CausalImpact (Google’s Bayesian Structural Time Series)  
```python
from causalimpact import CausalImpact

ci = CausalImpact(data, pre_period, post_period)
ci.summary()
```
CausalImpact estimates the effect of an intervention by comparing observed vs. counterfactual forecasted series  ([WillianFuks/tfcausalimpact: Python Causal Impact ... - GitHub](https://github.com/WillianFuks/tfcausalimpact?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

**Next Steps:**  
- Integrate these modules into your Flask service as new endpoints (e.g., `/forecast`, `/drivers`, `/scenario`)  
- Persist training data and forecasts in a time-series database (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB)  
- Schedule regular retraining and rebuild trajectory models via Celery or Airflow  

This architecture equips you with AI-driven forecasting, clear uncertainty quantification, driver insights, and scenario planning—transforming complexity analysis into a proactive decision-support system.
